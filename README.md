# 🚀 Ashita's DSA Journey

Welcome to my structured **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey!

I'm restarting from the basics with strong focus on:
- 📚 Fundamentals
- 🔁 Revision
- ✍️ Practice
- 🧠 Mindset

## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

- 🎓 B.Tech in Information Technology (2015)
- 👩‍💻 Front-End Developer (worked in a startup 2022-2024)
- 🎯 Restarting after breaks, family challenges & non-tech phases

My goal?  
**Help others like me who are confused, inconsistent, or overwhelmed** — by sharing not just *what* to learn but *how* to learn.
